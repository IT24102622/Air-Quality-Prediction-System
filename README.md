# PG191 AIML Project
# Beijing Air Quality Prediction Pipeline

## Overview
This project focuses on building a complete **data processing and analysis pipeline** for the Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality dataset. The pipeline integrates **data preprocessing, target creation, feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** into a single workflow. The output is a ready-to-use dataset for machine learning tasks predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) categories.
